# Bytebox
I make music, and I also write code. So, a project like this, which sits at the intersection of the two, is something I'd like to try.

The plan is to write an audio analyser that identifies beatbox sounds and triggers the appropriate MIDI notes. Broadly, it will recognise the sounds by analysing the sounds, and then asking the user to map each sound (within a configurable tolerance) to a MIDI note, including sending velocity information.

I have an idea of how I'm going to approach this at a technical level, which I will explain at some point.

This is in the initial stages and is not yet usable.
